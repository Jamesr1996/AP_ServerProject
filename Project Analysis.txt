Testing the project requires starting the server and telnetting in VIA putty.
hostname: localhost
port: 9801 (Unless specified otherwise)
connection type: raw
Close window on exit: Never

Once connected to the server in Putty, you can then use commands to manage data e.g. 
101
james
password

will login to the user "james" so long as it exists in the pwd.txt file.

Password File Stores User information in the form: 
Username Password

So for the above example, in order for me to be able to login the pwd.txt file must look like:
james password

(Note that for this to work you must also have the password on the same line as the username).

Users can be added to this file to create more accounts. Use FileWriters & FileOutputStreams to create 
new users by amending to the pwd.txt file.

User Data is stored in the 'userInfo' variable (of type Properties). This data is extracted in line 38 (MessageServer class)
and copied into userInfo in line 40.
